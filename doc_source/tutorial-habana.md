# The Habana DLAMI<a name="tutorial-habana"></a>

Instances with Habana accelerators are designed to provide high performance and cost efficiency for deep learning model training workloads\. Specifically, DL1 instance types use Habana Gaudi accelerators from Habana Labs, an Intel company\. Instances with Habana accelerators are configured with Habana SynapseAI software and pre\-integrated with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch\.

The following topics show you how to get started using Habana Gaudi hardware with the DLAMI\.
