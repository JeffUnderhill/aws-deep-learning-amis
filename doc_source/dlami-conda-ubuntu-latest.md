## Test Environments<a name="dlami-conda-ubuntu-latest-test-environments"></a>
+ Built on p2\.16xlarge\.
+ Also tested on p2\.xlarge, c4\.4xlarge\.

## Known Issues<a name="dlami-conda-ubuntu-latest-known-issues"></a>
+ **Issue**: PyTorch tests are broken\. \~/src/bin/testPyTorch \- installs test environment that is not compatible with the PyTorch 0\.3\.0

  **Workaround**: N/A
+ **Issue**: Tutorials provided by the framework or third parties may have Python dependencies not installed on the DLAMI\. 

  **Workaround**: You will need to install those while in the activated environment with conda or pip\.
+ **Issue**: Module not found error running Caffe2 examples\. 

  **Workaround**: [Caffe2 optional dependencies are needed for some tutorials](https://caffe2.ai/docs/getting-started.html)
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 model download features result in 404\. The models have changed locations since the v0\.8\.1 release\. Update models/download\.py to use the [update from master](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/python/models/download.py#L40)\.
+ **Issue**: matplotlib can only render png\. 

  **Workaround**: Install Pillow then restart your kernel\.
+ **Issue**: Changing Caffe2 source code doesn't seem to work\. 

  **Workaround**: Change your PYTHONPATH to use the install location `/usr/local/caffe2` instead of the build folder\.
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 net\_drawer errors\. 

  **Workaround**: Use the [logger patch found in this commit](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/commit/2b2744062cf4ac7599c77f70ea61d976629b934a#diff-1de171cab0b3f1f6618b1f26480c5945R29)\.
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 example shows an error regarding LMDB \(can't open DB, etc\.\) 

  **Workaround**: This will require a build from source after installing system LMDB, such as: `sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev`
+ **Issue**: SSH disconnects while using Jupyter server ties up your local port\. When trying create a tunnel to the server you see `channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 8057`\.

  **Workaround**: Use `lsof -ti:8057 | xargs kill -9` where 8057 is the local port you used\. Then try to create the tunnel to your Jupyter server again\.
