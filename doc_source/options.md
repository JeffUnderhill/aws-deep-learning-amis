# Choosing Your DLAMI<a name="options"></a>

We offer a range of DLAMI options\. To help you select the correct DLAMI for your use case, we group images by the hardware type or functionality for which they were developed\. Our top level groupings are:
+ **DLAMI Type:** CUDA versus Base versus Single\-Framework versus Multi\-Framework \(Conda DLAMI\)
+ **Compute Architecture:** x86\-based versus Arm\-based [AWS Graviton](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/)
+ **Processor Type:** [GPU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/gpu) versus [CPU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/cpu) versus [Inferentia](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/inferentia) versus [Habana](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/habana)
+ **SDK:** [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) versus [AWS Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/neuron-intro/get-started.html) versus [SynapsesAI](https://github.com/HabanaAI/Setup_and_Install)
+ **OS:** Amazon Linux versus Ubuntu
