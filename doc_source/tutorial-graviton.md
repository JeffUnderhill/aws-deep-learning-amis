# The Graviton DLAMI<a name="tutorial-graviton"></a>

AWS Graviton GPU DLAMIs are designed to provide high performance and cost efficiency for deep learning workloads\. Specifically, the G5g instance type features the Arm\-based [AWS Graviton2 processor](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/), which was built from the ground up by AWS and optimized for how customers run their workloads in the cloud\. AWS Graviton GPU DLAMIs are pre\-configured with Docker, NVIDIA Docker, NVIDIA Driver, CUDA, CuDNN, NCCL, and TensorRT, as well as popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch\.

With the G5g instance type, you can take advantage of the price and performance benefits of Graviton2 to deploy GPU\-accelerated deep learning models at a significantly lower cost when compared with x86\-based instances with GPU acceleration\.
